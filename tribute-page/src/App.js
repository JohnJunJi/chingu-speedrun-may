                            <h3>Early life</h3>
                            <p>
                                Desmond Doss was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, to William Thomas Doss, a carpenter, and Bertha Edward Doss (née Oliver),
                                a homemaker and shoe factory worker. His mother raised him as a devout
                                Seventh-day Adventist and instilled Sabbath-keeping, nonviolence, and a vegetarian lifestyle in his upbringing.
                                He grew up in the Fairview Heights area of Lynchburg, Virginia alongside his older sister Audrey and younger brother Harold.
                                Doss attended the Park Avenue Seventh-day Adventist Church school until the eighth grade, and subsequently
                                found a job at the Lynchburg Lumber Company to support his family during the Great Depression.
                            </p>
                            <h3>World War II service</h3>
                            <p>
                                Before the outbreak of World War II, Doss was employed as a joiner at a shipyard in Newport News, Virginia.
                                Doss entered military service – despite being offered a deferment for his shipyard work – on April 1, 1942 at Camp Lee, Virginia.
                                He was sent to Fort Jackson in South Carolina for training with the reactivated 77th Infantry Division.
                                Meanwhile, his brother Harold served aboard the USS Lindsey. Doss refused to kill an enemy soldier or carry a weapon
                                into combat because of his personal beliefs as a Seventh-day Adventist.
                                He consequently became a medic assigned to 2nd Platoon, B Company, 1st Battalion, 307th Infantry,
                                77th Infantry Division. While serving with his platoon in 1944 on Guam and the Philippines,
                                he was awarded a Bronze Star Medal for aiding wounded soldiers under fire. During the Battle of Okinawa,
                                he saved the lives of 75 wounded infantrymen[DTD 1] atop the Maeda Escarpment. Doss was wounded four times in Okinawa,
                                and was evacuated on May 21, 1945 aboard the USS Mercy.
